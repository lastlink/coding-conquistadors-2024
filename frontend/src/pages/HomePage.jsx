        CLTConnect is a digital platform designed to tackle the critical funding
        and sustainability challenges facing Community Land Trusts (CLTs) in
        their mission to preserve affordable housing. CLTs play a transformative
        role by enabling accessible homeownership and fostering long-term
        community stability. However, their unique structure often limits access
        to traditional financing options, creating a persistent need for
        alternative funding sources and collaboration. With CLTConnect, CLTs
        gain a comprehensive toolkit to connect with local governments, banks,
        philanthropic organizations, and potential donors who share their vision
        for stable, affordable communities. The app streamlines access to
        scalable funding opportunities, helps CLTs showcase their long-term
        benefits, and facilitates transparent partnerships. By addressing the
        core funding issue, CLTConnect empowers CLTs to expand their reach,
        acquire more properties, and continue making an impact on housing
        affordability for generations. Together, let's build a foundation for
        affordable homeownership and sustainable community growth.
